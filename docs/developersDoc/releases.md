# Release Process

[This process is for the Microsoft maintainers of this repo]

## Prerequisites for creating a release

- Write permissions on GitHub repo [ssc-spc-ccoe-cei/azure-guardrails-solution-accelerator](https://github.com/ssc-spc-ccoe-cei/azure-guardrails-solution-accelerator)
- [DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/guardrailssolutionaccelerator): a Service Connection named 'Guardrails Test Deployment Azure Connection' with sufficient rights to the target Azure tenant. 
- [DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/guardrailssolutionaccelerator): a Service Connection named 'Guardrails GitHub Connection' with write permissions to the Azure\GuardrailsSolutionAccelerator GitHub repo. Due to limitations on the GitHub org, this Service Connection currently relies on a scoped GitHub Personal Access Token, which is associated with an individual's GitHub account and subject to expiration. 
- [DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/guardrailssolutionaccelerator): a Service Connection named 'ESRP Guardrails Accelerator Signing' with access configured to Microsoft's internal ESRP code signing service

## Process to publish a full release or an interim release

Execution of the Release creation pipeline in Azure DevOps requires a new tag be added to trigger the pipeline. The tag must match the pattern: 'v*'. Interim releases are new releases created on top of a standard release with critical bug fixes, etc. When an interim release is created, the 'latest' tag is moved to the interim release. Interim releases should follow the version pattern v1.x.x.x. 

```git
# (After all PRs to be included are merged)
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git reset upstream/main --hard
```

**Update ./setup/tags.json** with the prerelease version number.

```git
git commit -am 'tags-v1.0.8'
git tag -f v1.0.8
git push upstream tag v1.0.8
```

Once the tag is pushed to GitHub, the tag created above will trigger the Pipeline named ['Azure.GuardrailsSolutionAccelerator Release Pipeline' in Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/guardrailssolutionaccelerator/GuardrailsSolutionAccelerator/_build?definitionId=11). Navigate to Azure DevOps to monitor the progress of the pipeline and address any issues. If the pipeline fails, a release will not be created in GitHub.
